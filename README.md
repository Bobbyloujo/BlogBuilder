##Blog Builder
This is a simple prototype blog editor and viewer for Android. The app can CRUD a list of blog posts. The posts
consist of modules that each contain text, an image, or a video. The modules can be reordered, edited, and deleted.
The final viewable post is constructed with HTML. Data persists between sessions.

This is meant to be a demonstration of my skill as an Android developer. I've learned some new tricks since creating
this and some updates may come in the future to reflect that.
